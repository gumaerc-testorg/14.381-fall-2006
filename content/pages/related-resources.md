Measurability
-------------

In this class, we do not need to worry about measurability, since it is not essential for understanding any of the key concepts. Here is a good, quick reference: Koenker, Roger. "Appendix to 13 Ways." {{% resource_link "0e9612bc-3e69-4284-94c2-80880ab54bc3" "Economics 574 Lecture Notes" %}}, Spring 2006.
